### Thesis: [Investigating the predictability of a chaotic time-series data using Reservoir computing, Deep-Learning and Machine- Learning on the short-, medium- and long-term pricing of Bitcoin and Ethereum.](https://github.com/m-kenny/Predicting_BTC_ETH)
This study will investigate the predictability of a Chaotic time-series data using Reservoir computing (Echo State Network), Deep-Learning(LSTM) and Machine- Learning(Linear, Bayesian, ElasticNetCV , Random Forest, XGBoost Regression and a machine learning Neural Network) on the short (1-day out prediction), medium (5-day out prediction) and long-term (30-day out prediction) pricing of Bitcoin and Ethereum.
